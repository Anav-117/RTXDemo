# View Dependant LOD

A proof of concept renderer that uses GLSL Tesselation shaders in Vulkan to implement a View Dependant Level-Of-Detail model using PN-Triangles.
This allows the use of low polygon models, where the renderer dynamically generates more triangles to enhance detail of objects that are closer to the camera.
